---- Description ----

     This Script opens all the websites stored in
     text file named "sitedb.txt" placed in the Script Folder
     
     There are some tricks here :

	1 - you can set a website as your favorite website 
	    by putting the character start `*` at the beginning
	    of it and if you use parameter "main" in the front 
            of your favsite command it will show you just your
	    favorite website if you don't it will show you all the websites

	2 - if you put the character single qoute `'` at the beginning of 
            a website it will comment it and it will not open when you run 
            the command even if it is your favorite website
	    
	//Note : The single quote character should be put on 
		 the first of line if a website is your
	         favorite website this character should be
		 at the first of line before the start character.
